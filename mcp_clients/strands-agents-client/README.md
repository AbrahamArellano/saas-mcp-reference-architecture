# Run instructions
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python mcp_strands_agent.py
```
Note: Requires Python version >3.10.x

## Strands agents workaround
The strands package currently has a problem by installing it from the requirements.txt or ask Q CLI to fix and install everything
Workaround:
- Clone GitHub project https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python
- Change to cloned repository and install library manually: `pip install -e .`
